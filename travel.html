                <p>
                    Palo Alto is a city located in the San Francisco Bay Area in California. Palo Alto was established in 1894 when Leland Stanford founded Stanford University. It is named after a costal redwood tree called El Palo Alto. It is home to many tech companies and startups, as well as Stanford University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Palo Alto has two main commercial areas, University Ave and California Ave, both of which have delicious restaurants and stores. Many people come to Palo Alto to see Stanford, but there’s so much more to do. Palo Alto is home to many nature preserves such as Foothills Park and the Baylands, which are popular for hiking, walking, biking, and other outdoor activities.

                <h3>Geographical Location: Europe</h3>
                <p>
                    Jungfrau is a city in Switzerland known for its mountain summits nicknamed the “top of Europe.” It is very famous also for its railway created in 1912 that can bring you to a height of 3454m. At the summit there are outstanding views where you can see the whole city and beyond.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The scenery consists of valleys, waterfalls, rock walls, and snow peaks. When visiting, it is vital to go on a day with good weather because it enhances the quality of the views. Hiking is very popular at short trails called Grutschalp and Murren. A very common tourist attraction is also exploring the Lauterbrunnen valley.

                <h3>Geographical Location: Europe</h3>
                <p>
                    The national capital of Italy remains a historical and political hub today. Nicknamed the “Eternal City,” Rome is considered the origination of the Catholic Church and Roman civilization central to the development of the Western World. Divided into 22 walled rioni (districts) surrounded by 35 quartieri urbani (urban sectors) that are surrounded by 6 large suburbi (suburbs), the city, just larger than New York City at an area of 496 mi2,  is home to 2.8 million residents. Its economy runs on the tourism and services industries, the latter mostly in government jobs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Via del Corso, named after Roman carnival horse races, is the main street that runs through Rome. Many significant churches, palaces, and squares run along this road (Piazza del Popolo, and the Spanish Steps in Piazza di Spagna, for example). The seven hills that surround Rome are trenched with mythological history which can be seen through the prevalence of temples. Must see landmarks for those traveling include the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Pantheon, and Catacombs. St. Peter’s Square & Basilica and the Sistine Chapel, technically located within Vatican City – an independent city-state within Rome – are also worth a visit.
