        <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
        <img src="images/bacon.jpg" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei" width="400">

        <p>
          Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days
          lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has
          gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long
          as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to
          avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like
          skills in chasing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon
          suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on
          a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a
          ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.
        </p>

        <h2>Cheeto (Chicken)</h2>
        <img src="images/cheeto_cattree.jpg" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower" width="400">

        <p>
          Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

        <h2>Milktea</h2>
        <img src="images/Main.JPG" alt="Milktea taking nap" width="400">

        <p>
          Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals’ health.

        <h2>Cooky</h2>
        <img src="images/cookysmiley.jpg" alt="White and gray Bernedoodle sitting on a couch and smiling." width="400">

        <p>
          Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.
        </p>
        <p>
          He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.

        <p>
          Chief is a 9 year old pomeranian who loves to sleep as much as he can. He naps anywhere, ranging from someone's bed to the grass outside. He enjoys walking outside, but keep watch of him, otherwise he will try to consume geese poop.
        </p>
        <p>
          He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much easier.

          Zack is an African grey parrot, aged around three years old. Zack loves flying and being outside of the cage at all times. He’s very nice but bites so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zack’s favorite foods are unsalted sunflower seeds and mangos. He loves being able to sit on people’s shoulder and talking to them. Zack knows over 500 words and learns more everyday.
